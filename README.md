# Keystone: Empowering Talented International Students to Access Higher Education

## Core Problem
Many brilliant students miss out on their dream universities due to financial constraints, lack of family support, and restrictive lending criteria. Existing financial solutions, like bank loans or organizations like Prodigy Finance, often rely heavily on credit scores, assets, or guarantors, excluding students with genuine potential but limited financial history. This lack of access perpetuates inequality and stifles opportunities for deserving students.

## Our Solution
Keystone reimagines education financing by prioritizing a student’s talent, potential, and ambitions over their financial background. The platform provides a space for students to showcase their CVs, personal stories, achievements, and goals, connecting them with investors who can either donate or negotiate loan terms. This personalized and human-centric approach ensures that decisions are based on future prospects rather than financial history.

## Key Features
- **Student Profiles**: A platform where students can highlight their achievements, aspirations, and funding needs through written profiles or presentation videos.
- **Investor Opportunities**: Investors can either donate directly or negotiate loans through Keystone, offering tailored terms without requiring collateral or credit scores.
- **Thorough Assessment**: Keystone evaluates students’ earning potential and motivations through their CVs, past work experiences, written samples, or interviews to ensure they are a suitable match for funding.
- **Win-Win Model**: Students gain access to education, investors enjoy high returns, and Keystone earns a commission for facilitating the process.

## Why It Matters
Keystone eliminates barriers to education for talented students, ensuring their potential is not wasted due to financial constraints. By offering a more inclusive and personalized alternative to traditional loans, Keystone creates opportunities for students to focus on their studies and unlock their full potential. At the same time, it provides investors with a structured way to support education while earning returns.

## Early Validation
The idea is inspired by personal experiences of financial struggles as international students in the UK. Direct conversations with students at Durham and Warwick confirm a widespread need for such a solution. Current financial systems fail to address these gaps, making Keystone a unique and impactful alternative.

## Passion and Vision
Driven by firsthand challenges in navigating education financing, Keystone is built on the belief that talent and ambition should never be limited by financial barriers. The goal is to transform access to education, starting in the UK and eventually expanding to empower students worldwide.

By combining empathy, innovation, and strategic execution, Keystone seeks to redefine how students access the education they deserve.
